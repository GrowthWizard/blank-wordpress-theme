# Blank WordPress Theme (Headless CMS / Rest API)
A WordPress Theme which doesn't show any content in the frontend and is completely blank. Since the Backend (exampledomain.de/wp-content) is still available, you can use this WordPress Theme as headless CMS for any Javascript Framework you like (i.e. via RestAPI). Enjoy!

# Demo
Check out https://content.steindominik.de/ to see how it works. But be aware, it's only a blank page which doesn't show you anything.
